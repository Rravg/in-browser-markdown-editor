## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- Node / Express
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Styled components make React Components more reusable and definitely simplified development of react appliations. Use of React's context api and context provider to share stateful variables across application. Proper use of mysql on the backend with express.


### Continued development

I would like to learn to use third party authenticator modules such as Firebase that offer possibility to use external accounts for authentication.
